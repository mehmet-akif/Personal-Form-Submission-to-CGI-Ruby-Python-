3. Submit the form to experience server-side handling via CGI scripts.

## Technology Stack
- **Ruby/Python**: CGI scripts for server-side processing.
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend for form creation and structure.
- **CGI (Common Gateway Interface)**: Connects web servers to external programs for server-side processing.


## Note
Ensure the web server environment supports CGI scripting for proper functionality.
